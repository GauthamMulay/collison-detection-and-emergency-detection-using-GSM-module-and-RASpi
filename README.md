# collison-detection-and-emergency-detection-using-GSM-module-and-RASpi

The aim is to detect rapid deceleration of the vehicle using accelerometer indicating an accident which then turns on the camera to capture stills from the surroundings. Further a call can be made to a emergency contact with the help of GSM module alerting them of the incident.
Components used are: RaspberryPi, GSM Module, Accelerometer and a Camera.
We also made use of AT commands for the communication.
